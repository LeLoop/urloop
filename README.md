URLoop
======

URLoop, Le Loop's URL manipulat0r.

This is a command line tool that parse IRC logs to push urls with `#tags#` on a
Semantic Scuttle instance.

Configuration
=============

- `logs_parsed.yml` : do not touch it, as it is auto generated by the tool ; it only needs
  to contain `"--- []"` to start correctly the first time or to not exist (an empty file is invalid).
- `crap.yml` : list of URLs to ignore from being parsed
- `synonyms.yml` : list of synonyms
